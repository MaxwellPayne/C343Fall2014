As of midnight, we have the BST.py file working and passing all of the tests, as well as the times plotted on a graph. However, our avl.py file is not functional yet, and so we could not run the tests or plot the graph quite yet.

Hopefully we will be able to keep working and figure some more of the avl.py functions out to make them work.
