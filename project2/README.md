Floodit.py: a surprisingly challenging tile game

floodit.py currently imports the faster flood function from flood2.py
to run the old, crappy version, import flood from flood1.py instead

To view a plot of flood1's performance compared to that of flood2, run the command "python plotter.py times1.csv times2.csv"
